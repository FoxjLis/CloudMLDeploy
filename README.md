# Dental Implant Recognition System

## Description
Welcome to the Dental Implant Recognition project repository. This project uses machine learning technology to accurately identify implant brands based on images.

## Features
The project includes:
- Training a model based on YOLOv8 to recognize implants.
- Testing the model for accuracy verification.
- Validation sets for parameter optimization.

## Getting Started
